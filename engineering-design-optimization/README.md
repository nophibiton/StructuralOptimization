# Engineering design optimization

This repository provides Matlab codes for different algorithms used in Engineering Design Optimization by Martins and Ning (2021). The book is freely available online and can be downloaded here [https://mdobook.github.io/](https://mdobook.github.io/).

The follwing matlab codes are arrange based on book chapters/sections. The following includes:
1) [Newton Methods](./3-8%20Newton%20Based%20Solvers/)
2) [Line Search Algorithms](./4-3%20Line%20search/)
   - Backtracking (Armijo rule)
   - Strong wolfe conditions
3) [Search direction](./4-4%20Search%20direction/)
   - [steepest descent](./4-4%20Search%20direction/1%20Steepest%20Descent/)
   - [BFGS](./4-4%20Search%20direction/2%20BFGS/)
   - [LBFGS](./4-4%20Search%20direction/3%20LBFGS/)
4) [Nelder-Mead algorithm](./7-3%20Nelder-Mead%20algorithm/)
5) [Particle swarm optimization](./7-7%20Particle%20swarm%20optimization/)
